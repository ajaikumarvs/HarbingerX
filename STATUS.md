## ⚠️ CURRENT ISSUES

### 1. Go Backend Compilation Errors
```
backend/scanner/service.go:430:37: totalTime.Sub undefined (type time.Duration has no field or method Sub)
backend/config/manager.go:139:18: invalid operation: operator ! not defined on string(key)[0:7]
backend/ai/service.go:188:18: undefined: openai.GPT35Turbo
```

### 2. Wails Bindings Generation Failed
- Backend compilation errors prevent Wails from generating TypeScript bindings
- Frontend imports commented out: `// import { GetDashboardStats, GetAllScans } from '../../wailsjs/go/main/App'`

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE TODO (High Priority)

### 1. Fix Go Compilation Errors
- [ ] **Fix time.Duration.Sub issue** in `backend/scanner/service.go:430`
  - Replace with proper time arithmetic
- [ ] **Fix string operation** in `backend/config/manager.go:139`
  - Fix boolean operation on string slice
- [ ] **Fix OpenAI constant** in `backend/ai/service.go:188`
  - Update to correct OpenAI model constant (likely `openai.GPT3Dot5Turbo`)

### 2. Generate Wails Bindings
- [ ] Run `wails build` successfully
- [ ] Verify TypeScript bindings generated in `frontend/wailsjs/`
- [ ] Uncomment and test frontend-backend integration

### 3. Test Full Integration
- [ ] Test scan functionality end-to-end
- [ ] Verify AI report generation
- [ ] Test PDF/JSON export
- [ ] Validate configuration management

## 📋 FEATURE TODO (Medium Priority)

### 1. Enhanced Dashboard
- [ ] Real-time scan progress updates
- [ ] System health monitoring
- [ ] Threat intelligence feeds
- [ ] Security metrics visualization

### 2. Advanced Scanning Features
- [ ] Custom scan profiles
- [ ] Scheduled scanning
- [ ] Scan comparison and diff
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipelines

### 3. Reporting & Analytics
- [ ] Advanced PDF report templates
- [ ] Executive summary generation
- [ ] Trend analysis and insights
- [ ] Custom report formatting

### 4. Security Enhancements
- [ ] API key encryption
- [ ] Scan result encryption
- [ ] User authentication system
- [ ] Role-based access control

## 🎯 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Low Priority)

### 1. Plugin System
- [ ] Custom vulnerability scanners
- [ ] Third-party integration plugins
- [ ] Custom report generators

### 2. Cloud Integration
- [ ] Cloud storage for scan results
- [ ] Team collaboration features
- [ ] Centralized management dashboard

### 3. Mobile Companion
- [ ] Mobile app for scan monitoring
- [ ] Push notifications for critical issues
- [ ] Remote scan management

### Build Commands
```bash
# Frontend development
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Frontend production build
cd frontend && npm run build

# Full Wails application build (currently failing)
wails build

# Development with hot reload
wails dev
```

### Environment Requirements
- Go 1.19+ 
- Node.js 16+
- Wails v2.10.1
- Linux/Windows/macOS support

## 🚀 GETTING STARTED (For Resuming Work)

1. **Fix Go compilation errors** (see issues above)
2. **Test Wails build**: `wails build`
3. **Generate bindings**: Should happen automatically with successful build
4. **Test integration**: Uncomment frontend imports and test API calls
5. **Add missing methods**: Implement any missing backend methods
6. **Polish UI**: Add loading states, error handling, animations

## 📝 NOTES

- **Tailwind v4**: Successfully configured and working
- **Design System**: Glassmorphism theme fully implemented
- **Architecture**: Clean separation between frontend and backend
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript interfaces and Go structs well-defined
- **Performance**: Optimized build pipeline with Vite
- **Scalability**: Modular backend services for easy extension
